# Churn_modelling_KNIME
The first Workflow I created in KNIME, as a part of the module Big Data, at Educx. For the visualisations, I used Tableau Public.

In this project, a **Workflow in KNIME** is created to examine a data set on *Churn Modelling* from *Kaggle* https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimechlearn/churn-modelling. The goal is to predict whether bank customers will churn or not, based on various characteristics such as customersâ€™ age, gender, salary, credit score, balance, number of products etc. Additionally, a connection between churn and some characteristics of customers is visualised in **Tableau Public**.
The dashboard is pulished at my profile https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanja.srdanovic#!
